# 'Frequency Modulation Tx-Rx using USRP'

This project implements a Frequency Modulation (FM) Transmitter-Receiver system using a USRP (Universal Software Radio Peripheral) with MATLAB and UHD. The setup enables real-time transmission and reception of FM signals, demonstrating SDR (Software-Defined Radio) capabilities for wireless communication experiments.

Features:
* FM signal generation and transmission via USRP
* Real-time FM reception and demodulation
* MATLAB-based signal processing
* UHD driver support for seamless USRP integration

Requirements:
* USRP B210 or compatible SDR
* MATLAB with Communications Toolbox & UHD Support
* Antennas for Tx & Rx

Usage:
* Configure USRP parameters (center frequency, sample rate, gain).
* Transmit an FM-modulated signal.
* Receive and demodulate the signal for playback or analysis.
